            <h2>Description</h2>

                <p> Pad Thai is a dish typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, egg, sugar, and bean sprouts. This dish's origin is easy to spot as it is in the name, Thailand! Even though stir-fried rice noodles arrived in Thailand from China centuries ago, Pad Thai was invented in the mid-20th century.</p>
